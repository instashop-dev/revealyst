// W5-F deliverable (1): the milestone/positive insight kind (Spec V4 §7.3, §8.4).
//
// Milestones are the FIRST celebratory surface in the product — "positive-first
// becomes real" (§8.4). A milestone is a grounded, measured achievement drawn
// from signals the page already has in hand; it invents no number and no claim
// (invariant b). Pure: no React, no I/O, no clock, no storage.
//
// ── v0 is recompute-on-read, NO storage (the §8.4 decision) ────────────────────
// Every milestone here is recomputed from rows already in the caller's flat
// batch (the G10 perf law — never a new request-time query). "Show-once"
// semantics would need a state table under the §15.2 law; v0 is
// BADGE-UNTIL-SUPERSEDED instead: a milestone keeps rendering until the
// comparison that produced it no longer holds. That is why every detector
// compares against a real PRIOR baseline (last period's breadth, the prior
// trend max) rather than a fixed zero — a fixed-zero baseline would re-fire the
// same milestone forever (the exact `isNewBest` trap: `current >= best` claimed
// a "new best" every week on a flat trend).
//
// ── Strictness inherits `isNewBest`'s `>` (never `>=`) ─────────────────────────
// A tie with the prior baseline is NOT a new achievement. `new-best` is gated by
// the caller's strict `isNewBest` (src/lib/digest-content.ts `scoreLine`);
// `feature-breadth` rides W5-E's `compareWorkflowDiversity`, whose
// `crossedMilestone` requires `current >= T AND previous < T` — the crossing is
// strict in `previous`, so a threshold already reached last period never re-fires.
//
// ── The NO-STREAK decision (§8.4, founder sign-off §9(3); recorded here) ────────
// Weekly consistency with forgiveness is rendered as NARRATIVE COPY ONLY — no
// streak counter UI, no streak flame, no daily anything. The Duolingo NOT-list
// (XP / leagues / streak flames / hearts) is a review-blocker (§8.4, tripwire
// rule 7). So the `weekly-cadence` milestone below carries NO number in its copy
// (it never says "4 weeks running"): it states the RHYTHM, not a count to
// protect. `activeWeeks` gates whether it fires; it is never rendered.
